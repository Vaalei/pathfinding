# Pathfinding with a BFS algorithm
* Can use verbose or non verbose
  * Verbose shows the process of the algorithm in real time

# TODO
* The ability to create walls
  * Loop from 1 pos to another?
* setStartPosition & setGoalPosition taking arguments
  * +removing old start location when using arguments
* Import graphs????


* Adding argument to BFS to change time delay between different steps in algorithm, (verbose)
